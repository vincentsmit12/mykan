## Base URL

```
https://bsocial.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication using your API key. You can create one in the [settings page](https://bsocial.com/settings) of your account. Include this key in the `x-api-key` header of each request.

```
'x-api-key': kan_123456789
```

## Response codes

BSocial uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, `2xx` HTTP codes correspond to success, `4xx` codes are for user-related failures, and `5xx` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Success                         |
| `400`  | Invalid parameters              |
| `401`  | Missing token                   |
| `403`  | Invalid token                   |
| `404`  | Resource not found              |
| `500`  | Error with BSocial's infrastructure |
